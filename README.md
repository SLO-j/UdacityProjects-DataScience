This section will be used to upload all my Udacity projects in data science.

The first project i worked on was education proformance analysis. I selected education dataset was taken from Ibrahim Aljarah https://www.kaggle.com/aljarah/xAPI-Edu-Data.
in this project I answered 3 questions they are:
- Which country got the highest Parent school Satisfaction? 
- How do absences affect parent-school satisfaction ? 
- Which topics got the highest number of raised hands?
